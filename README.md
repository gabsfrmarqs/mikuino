Howdy! Here's the original code with 80% of Anamanaguchi - Miku on Arduino. I was sleep deprived so don't judge pls. A great percentage of this code was written using scripts to convert .mid to Arduino code.

  

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTEYTcaI_LQ) the video with the full song!

This code is not smart at all. I had to create another script to convert the ouput of a midi-to-arduinocode converter into an array thingy then throw it into my code, IT IS CHAOTIC BUT IT SOUNDS COOL AND LOOKS COOL. 

This is so stupid that i'm basically using 90%+ from the Arduinos memory, there's no more space.


I believe [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OSewi7d_4E) is the original .midi I've used. I did edit it to play only one note each time, otherwise:
- the arduino memory gets full
- it sounds terrible

Also i'm not using a buzzer, I'm actually using a speaker thingy from a broken JBL headphone.
